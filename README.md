MINISHELL PROJECT!!!

The most difficult project on my 42 Paris course. The goal is to create our very own shell. But small. (which, does not really make your situation easier.)

I am currently working on this project with my teammate. This project is an AMAZING opportunity to learn as it is pretty complex.
Good luck to us!
